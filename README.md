# Malachite - UMD MATH425 Final Project

## Overview

This repository contains the scripts and code I developed for "Malachite," the final project for UMD's MATH425 (Game Programming) class.

The complete game project, including assets, engine configuration, and integrated code from other team members, is privately hosted by its owner. This repository serves as a portfolio piece to specifically showcase my individual programming contributions. While the full, runnable game is not included here, the provided scripts demonstrate my technical skills in game development, particularly in AI and UI implementation.

## Project Description

"Malachite" is a third-person dungeon-exploration game developed in Unity by a five-person team. Players delve into challenging dungeons, confront various enemy types, and navigate interactive environments. Our goal was to create a cohesive and engaging gameplay experience, leveraging Unity's capabilities for 3D game development.

## My Core Contributions (Code Portfolio Focus)

My primary role in the team focused on **Enemy AI Systems** and **User Interface Design and Implementation**. I contributed significantly to the core gameplay mechanics that brought our enemies to life and provided players with intuitive feedback.

### Key Systems and Features Implemented:

*   **Enemy AI System:**
*   Designed and implemented the artificial intelligence for three distinct enemy types, each with unique attack patterns and behaviors.
*   Utilized **Unity's NavMeshAgent** for robust pathfinding, allowing enemies to intelligently navigate complex dungeon layouts, avoid obstacles, and pursue the player.
*   Integrated **physics Colliders (Box, Sphere, Mesh)** with trigger volumes to detect player presence, initiate combat, and manage interactions effectively.
*   Managed the process of **baking NavMeshes** for diverse level geometries, ensuring seamless enemy movement across all dungeon sections.
*   Developed State Machines for each enemy type to manage transitions between patrolling, chasing, attacking, and retreating states, adding depth to combat encounters.
*   **Enhanced User Interface (UI) Design & Implementation:**
*   Developed and implemented various UI elements, focusing on clarity and visual representation techniques to provide immediate and intuitive player feedback.
*   Coded dynamic HUD components (e.g., health bars, ability cooldowns) that react to in-game events.
*   Implemented core menu systems (e.g., pause menu, game over screen) with a focus on user experience.
*   **General Programming & Debugging:**
*   Maintained attention to detail in coding practices, ensuring clean, modular, and maintainable C# scripts.
*   Actively engaged in debugging complex systems across the project, troubleshooting issues related to physics, AI, and inter-system communication.
*   Implemented various complex features within the Unity 3D environment, contributing to the overall stability and functionality of the game.

## Technologies Used

*   **Game Engine:** Unity 3D
*   **Programming Language:** C#
